  <h3>HOW DID WE MEET?</h3>

  <p>
    I am sure some of you have heard us side-step this question before. The truth, we met online. As we like to
    joke, we met at
    our favorite place: the computer. It being 2012, and given our respective careers, it only seems tting. Neither
    of us signed
    up willingly, we only logged on once, but the rest is history. Because I guess, it only takes one.
  </p>

  <h3>HOW DID HE PROPOSE?</h3>

  <p>
    The rst time was in November, we had just seen the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. As we were walking out of
    the
    theater, we stumbled upon the park bench we had sat at for hours when we had rst started dating. Rockefeller
    Center was
    empty, we sat down, and Paul asked. And Annie said yes!
  </p>

  <p>
    Ever the traditionalist, Paul wanted to do it again with a ring and her dad’s permission. So we kept it quiet,
    he nished
    shopping, and Paul planned to ask Christmas morning at Annie’s home in Texas. The ring was burning a hole in his
    pocket
    on the flight in, so in the Terminal E parking lot of DFW Airport, Paul got down on one knee and Annie said yes,
    again!

    <h4>JOE T. GARCIA'S</h4>
    <p>
      We guarantee when you say you've been to Fort Worth, at least one person will ask: "Did you got
      to Joe T's?" Great atmosphere and killer margaritas, but be warned: they are strong!
    </p>
    <h4>RAILHEAD BARBECUE</h4>
    <p>
      There is always debate about the best place to get barbecue in town, but we recommend Railhead
      for a good hearty Texas meal. You can even bring a bit of Texas home with you, they ship!
    </p>
    <h4>WHATABURGER</h4>
    <p>
      Maybe not the healthiest joint, still Whataburger has developed a cult following in Texas. But
      really, it doesn't get much better than a Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit.

      or get your two-step on at Billy Bob's, "The World's Largest Honky Tonk."

    <h4>THE MUSEUM DISTRICT</h4>

      With three stellar, world-renowned museums clustered together everyone is bound to see
      something they fancy. Check out the Amon Carter, the Kimbell, &amp; the Modern for a bit of culture.
    </p>
    <h4>FORT WORTH ZOO</h4>
    <p>
      With lions and tigers and bears, oh my, it's no wonder Fort Worth's Zoo is ranked the No. 5
      Zoo in the nation.
