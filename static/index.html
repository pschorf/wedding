  <h3>HOW DID WE MEET?</h3>

  <p>
    I am sure some of you have heard us side-step this question before. The truth, we met online. As we like to
    joke, we met at
    our favorite place: the computer. It being 2012, and given our respective careers, it only seems tting. Neither
    of us signed
    up willingly, we only logged on once, but the rest is history. Because I guess, it only takes one.
  </p>

  <h3>HOW DID HE PROPOSE?</h3>

  <p>
    The rst time was in November, we had just seen the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. As we were walking out of
    the
    theater, we stumbled upon the park bench we had sat at for hours when we had rst started dating. Rockefeller
    Center was
    empty, we sat down, and Paul asked. And Annie said yes!
  </p>

  <p>
    Ever the traditionalist, Paul wanted to do it again with a ring and her dad’s permission. So we kept it quiet,
    he nished
    shopping, and Paul planned to ask Christmas morning at Annie’s home in Texas. The ring was burning a hole in his
    pocket
    on the flight in, so in the Terminal E parking lot of DFW Airport, Paul got down on one knee and Annie said yes,
    again!
