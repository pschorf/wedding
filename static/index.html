      <h3>HOW DID WE MEET?</h3>
      <p>
        I am sure some of you have heard us side-step this question before.  The truth, we met online. As we like to joke, we met at
        our favorite place: the computer. It being 2012, and given our respective careers, it only seems tting. Neither of us signed 
        up willingly, we only logged on once, but the rest is history. Because I guess, it only takes one.
      </p>
      <h3>HOW DID HE PROPOSE?</h3>
      <p>
        The rst time was in November, we had just seen the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. As we were walking out of the 
        theater, we stumbled upon the park bench we had sat at for hours when we had rst started dating. Rockefeller Center was 
        empty, we sat down, and Paul asked. And Annie said yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever the traditionalist, Paul wanted to do it again with a ring and her dad’s permission. So we kept it quiet, he nished 
        shopping, and Paul planned to ask Christmas morning at Annie’s home in Texas. The ring was burning a hole in his pocket 
        on the flight in, so in the Terminal E parking lot of DFW Airport, Paul got down on one knee and Annie said yes, again!
